    Abstract base class for face attribute models.

    This class defines the common interface that all attribute models
    (e.g., age-gender, emotion) must implement. It ensures a consistent API
    across different attribute prediction modules in the library, making them
    interchangeable and easy to use.

        inference session (e.g., ONNX Runtime, PyTorch), and any necessary
        warm-up procedures to prepare the model for prediction.

        This method should take a raw image and any other necessary data
