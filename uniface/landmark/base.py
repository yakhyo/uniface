        Predicts facial landmarks for a given face bounding box.

        This method defines the standard interface for all landmark predictors.
        It takes a full image and a bounding box for a single face and returns
        the predicted keypoints for that face.

        Args:
            image (np.ndarray): The full source image in BGR format.
            bbox (np.ndarray): A bounding box of a face [x1, y1, x2, y2].

        Returns:
            np.ndarray: An array of predicted landmark points with shape (N, 2),
                        where N is the number of landmarks.
